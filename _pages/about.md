I'm a 5th year PhD candidate in the [Department of Cognitive Sciences](https://www.cogsci.uci.edu/) at  UC Irvine, where I am advised by [Dr. Bryce Mander](https://www.faculty.uci.edu/profile/?facultyId=6367). I am also concurrently enrolled in the joint MS in [Statistics](https://www.stat.uci.edu). My research interests include sleep, brain rhythms, and memory in aging and neurodegenerative disease.
